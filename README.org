#+TITLE: Advent of Code 2018 solutions

Just like [[https://github.com/cjsmeele/aoc2017/][last year]], I have no
intention or expectation to finish all puzzles. After all, there is only so much time and
that many projects to work on. :-)

With that said, let's see how far we get this year, using Haskell!

To run any of the solutions:

: cabal new-run day01

Optionally provide the input file name as an extra argument.
